- **Left Click:** Close your right hand to hold the left click button (for breaking blocks and hitting).
- **Right Click:** Touch your right hand's index finger and thumb to right-click (for placing blocks).
- **Move Forward:** Open your left hand to press 'W' (to move forward).
- **Inventory:** Lift two fingers on your left hand (âœŒ) to press 'E' (to open the inventory).
